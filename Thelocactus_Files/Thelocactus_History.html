            <p class="figure-block">
              <span class="dropcap">T</span>he first <i>Thelocactus</i> to appear in
              <span class="img-anchor" id="fig1-anchor"></span>Europe was <i>Thelocactus leucacanthus</i>. This species
              was discovered by Karwinski near Zimap&#225;n, and sent to the M&#252;nchen botanical garden around 1830.
              At that time it was ascribed to the genus <i>Echinocactus</i>, as was the case with most of the globular
              cacti. The name<i> Thelocactus</i> appeared in the literature many years later, introduced by K. Schumann,
              who in his 'opus magnum', <i>Gesamtbeschreibung der Kakteen</i>, used it to identify a subgenus of the
              then mastodontic genus <i>Echinocactus</i>. In it Schumann included a series of species sharing the common
              character of a stem divided into tubercles, from which the name <i>Thelocactus</i> ('thele' in Greek means
              nipple).<br />
              <br />
              <span class="dropcap">A</span>bout thirty years later, Britton and Rose raised <i>Thelocactus</i> to the
              rank of genus, designating <i>Thelocactus hexaedrophorus </i>as the type species, and including twelve
              taxa that still belong to it today. After Britton and Rose's work, many other species were added to the
              original group, both as new species and as combinations. Furthermore, the genus underwent some revisions
              that modified the taxonomy and therefore the nomenclature of the species involved. Some of the species
              combined in <i>Thelocactus</i> (<i>T</i>. <i>gielsdorfianus</i>,<i> T</i>.<i> knuthianus</i>,<i> T</i>.
              <i>saueri</i>,<i> T</i>. <i>viereckii</i>, <i>T</i>.<i> subterraneus</i>) were afterwards included by
              Backeberg in a related genus,<i> Gymnocactus</i>, today a synonym of <i>Turbinicarpus</i>.<br />
              <br />
              <span class="dropcap">T</span>he Eighties<span class="img-anchor" id="fig3-anchor"></span> saw the
              description of some new taxa, both at variety and species rank, and, by Anderson, a revision of the genus.
              In this revision the author included <i>Hamatocactus setispinus</i> in <i>Thelocactus</i>, basing his
              proposal on the similarities between many of the characters chosen to compare the species
              <i>Thelocactus bicolor</i> and <i>Hamatocactus setispinus.</i> This new delimitation of<i> Thelocactus</i>
              totally upset the limits of the genus: the two essential characters on which Britton and Rose had based
              the genus, i.e. the presence of tubercles, that gave the genus its name, and fruits dehiscent at the base,
              disappeared, since<i> Hamatocactus setispinus</i> has no tubercles and has fleshy, indehiscent fruits.<br />
              <br />
              <span class="dropcap">S</span>ince Anderson's revision, more species have been described (<i
                >Thelocactus garciae, Thelocactus multicephalus, Thelocactus flavus</i
              >) and others have been segregated from the genus. Doweld, in 1998, has proposed the separation of<i>
                Thelocactus conothelos</i
              >
              and its varieties from <i>Thelocactus</i> and the inclusion of these taxa in a new genus, all based only
              on the differences in the micro-morphology of the seed cuticle, that in these species is smooth instead of
              finely granular. Later, the work by Mosco and Zanovello allowed them to state that <i>Hamatocactus </i>is
              not congeneric with <i>Thelocactus</i>, and to revise the taxonomic position of a few taxa. In the year
              2000 a consistent number of new names has been added to the ones already known, due to the work of some
              Czechoslovakian authors who have taken the trouble to describe some mere local forms.<br />
              <br />
              <span class="dropcap">T</span>he latest reference book to cacti for many years to come is
              <i>The New Cactus Lexicon</i>, published in 2006 and edited by D. Hunt, N. Taylor and G. Charles on behalf
              of the International Cactaceae Systematics Group (ICSG). The taxonomic treatment of <i>Thelocactus</i> is
              more on the conservative side, but there are some choices I do not agree with. The inclusion of
              <i>Hamatocactus bicolor</i> (syn. <i>Hamatocactus setispinus</i>) in <i>Thelocactus</i> has no grounds due
              to the relevant differences in body morphology (presence or absence of tubercles) as well as fruit and
              seed morphology. <i>Thelocactus conothelos</i> ssp. <i>flavus</i> is treated as a synonym of
              <i>Thelocactus conothelos</i> ssp. <i>aurantiacus</i>, but the two are considerably different for what
              concerns stem habit and spination. The fact is that <i>T. conothelos</i> ssp. <i>flavus</i> is distinct
              from any <i>conothelos</i> subspecies for its clustering stems and spination pattern, while
              <i>T. conothelos</i> ssp. <i>aurantiacus</i> is indistinguishable from the type species if not in flower.
              I really do not understand the rationale underlaying the synonymization of ssp. <i>flavus</i> and on the
              contrary the retention of, say, ssp. <i>garciae</i>, which is barely distinguishable from ssp.
              <i>conothelos</i>. A strong lumping approach was used with the <i>rinconensis</i> complex, where none
              subspecies was accepted, while for the <i>bicolor</i> complex a different approach was followed and all
              subspecies were considered "good". This is unintelligible, as to me a <i>T. rinconensis</i> ssp.
              <i>nidulans</i> is far more distinct from a <i>T. rinconensis</i> than a <i>T. bicolor</i> ssp.
              <i>bolaensis</i> from a <i>T. bicolor</i> is. The lumping approach did not affect
              <i>T. hexaedrophorus</i> ssp. <i>lloydii</i>, which is described as having 1-3 central spines and on this
              basis distinguished from ssp. <i>hexaedrophorus</i>. Interestingly, the original description does not
              mention the presence of central spines, so where they have found them is a mystery. To conclude the
              overall taxonomic treatment is incongruent, with some species that were treated in a more conservative way
              than others were. There is still an error to be pointed out. <i>Thelocactus</i> seeds have a flat or
              convex relief, but never concave or par-concave as stated in the genus description.<br />
              <br />
              <span class="dropcap">S</span>ome nomenclatural changes, proposed by G. F. Matuszewski and S. Hinz, can be
              found in their monograph <i>Thelocactus</i>, published in 2011. The book is well illustrated with a lot of
              beautiful pictures depicting any form of the known species. Alas, it is written in Polish and German,
              which prevents the understanding to the majority of people. The authors revised the nomenclature of the
              <i>T. rinconensis</i> complex according to their opinion that <i>T. lophothele</i> is identifiable with
              the plants growing on the northern side of the highway from Saltillo to Monterrey. That both are varieties
              of the same species is an old idea, but because tha place of origin of <i>lophothele</i> was stated being
              Chihuahua, where till now no plant matching the description has been found, the name was set apart in the
              most recent works. If <i>lophothele</i> is considered a good species, say close to <i>rinconensis</i>,
              nomenclature has to be adjusted, because <i>lophothele</i> has priority over <i>rinconensis</i>, what the
              authors did. To support their taxonomic point of view, the authors relied on a phenetic analysis based on
              50 characters, and here a criticism can be made because they did not said what characters were chosen, and
              the software used to run the phenetic analysis.<br />
              <br />
              <span class="dropcap">T</span>he genomic era has made available new tools for the study of phylogenetic
              relationships among organisms. Molecular data are now commonly used to study plant lineages at shallow or
              deep levels, and Cactaceae are no exception. Several studies have been made to test the monophyly of the
              subfamilies or tribes as well as to resolve intergeneric relationships and to assess the monophyly of
              extant genera using chloroplast DNA sequence data. <i>Thelocactus</i> belongs to the tribe Cacteae, which
              is monophyletic, but the limits of its genera are still matters of debate. In their study,
              <a class="barl" href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14772000.2013.775191" target="_blank"
                >Vásquez-Sánchez and coauthors, </a
              >have found that <i>Ferocactus</i> is polyphyletic because it is grouped in the same clade together with
              <i>Glandulicactus, Leuchtembergia, Stenocactus</i> and <i>Thelocactus</i>. The authors have suggested
              considering all these genera as <i>Ferocactus</i> until new data will support them. Nevertheless, this
              analysis is incomplete, at least for what concerns <i>Thelocactus</i>, because three species,
              <i>T. buekii</i>, <i>T. lausseri</i>, and <i>T. multicephalus</i>, were not included in the analysis which
              means that we have to wait for further studies to have a complete understanding of the interspecific
              relationships in this genus.
